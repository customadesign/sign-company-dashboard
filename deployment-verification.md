## Troubleshooting

### If deployment hasn't completed:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for Render to complete the build
2. Check Render dashboard for build logs
3. Verify no build errors in the deployment

### If share section doesn't appear:
1. Clear browser cache and hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify CalendarShareSection component is imported correctly

### If styling looks broken:
1. Ensure CSS file is being loaded
2. Check for conflicting styles in browser DevTools
3. Verify Tailwind CSS classes are compiling correctly

## API Endpoints

The share functionality relies on:
- `/api/events/calendar.ics` - iCal feed endpoint
- Should return proper iCal formatted data
- Must be publicly accessible for external calendar apps

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the deployment completion on Render
2. Run through the testing checklist
3. Collect any user feedback on the new placement
4. Address any issues that arise during testing

## Success Metrics

- Users can easily find and use calendar sharing options
- Improved engagement with calendar subscriptions
- Positive feedback on the new design and placement
- No regression in existing calendar functionality
