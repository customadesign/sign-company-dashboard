# Interactive Map Implementation

## Overview
I've successfully implemented an interactive map for the Map Search page using Leaflet, an open-source mapping library that doesn't require API keys.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Interactive Map Display
- OpenStreetMap tiles (free, no API key required)
- Responsive design that works well with the existing layout
- Smooth animations when selecting locations

### 2. Location Markers
- **Green markers**: Open locations
- **Red markers**: Closed locations
- **Blue markers**: Currently selected location
- Clickable markers with popup information

### 3. Map Interactions
- Click on any marker to view location details
- Popup shows basic information with a "View Details" button
- Map automatically centers on selected locations with smooth animation
- Full integration with the existing location list

### 4. Responsive Design
- Map expands/collapses using the existing button functionality
- Works seamlessly with the show/hide list feature
- Maintains proper aspect ratio on different screen sizes

## Technical Details

### Dependencies Added
- `leaflet`: Core mapping library
- `react-leaflet`: React components for Leaflet
- `@types/leaflet`: TypeScript definitions

### Key Components
- `MapView.tsx`: Reusable map component
- Integrated into `MapSearch.tsx` page
- No API keys or environment variables needed

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

### 1. User Location
- Add geolocation to show user's current position
- Calculate real distances from user location
- Sort locations by actual distance

### 2. Search Integration
- Filter markers based on search input
- Highlight searched locations
- Auto-zoom to search results

### 3. Advanced Features
- Clustering for many locations
- Custom marker icons for different services
- Route planning/directions
- Heat maps for service coverage

### 4. Alternative Map Providers
If you want different map styles, you can easily switch to:
- **MapTiler**: Free tier available, requires API key
- **Mapbox**: Premium features, requires API key
- **Google Maps**: Most features, requires API key

## Usage
The map is now live at http://127.0.0.1:5173/map and includes:
- 6 sample franchise locations in Arizona
- Color-coded markers based on open/closed status
- Full integration with existing filters and search
- Responsive design that works on all devices

No additional configuration needed!
